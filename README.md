#Autrui

**Purpose**

With the advent of technology in the daily lives of people in the past decade, it has been through many forms of uses â€“ from being a luxury to utility to now a means of entertainment. We see that with though this transition has bought greater connectivity and access to information, it has also lost compassion somewhere down the road. The whole world of the social network seems cold and lacks benevolence. We have decided to carry the idea of bridging this gap, by creating a mobile application that aims at bridging this gap. 

The app is inspired by the Pay It Forward Movement. The idea is to respond to a person's kindness to oneself by being kind to someone else. Our app focuses on providing a social platform where users will be able to connect through these kind deeds, and see the impact of their deed.

##Instructions##

Once the project has been pulled from the master branch, you need to do the following to compile and run the project:

- Remove the Splash project from your workspace(Delete it, but make sure to not delete the files from your computer)
- Import the my_autrui folder which is inside Main App folder and copy the contents to your workspace (make sure the workspace is different from the autrui-repo)
- Import the facebook folder by going into (Main App/facebook-android-sdk-master/) and then clicking on facebook, also copy the contents into your workspace
- Clean your project
- Next if all of the errors dont do away, right click on my_autrui (or the name of the folder which has our app) and then click on properties
- Then click on 'Android' on your left hand side and see if the library part of the window is empty (this will be near the bottom of the window).
- If it is empty then add Facebook (If you have imported it correctly it should be called FacebookSDK) as a library and click on Apply and then Ok
- Clean your project
- Run as done so previously


#Errors#
It can happen that you still might get errors and that is because you don't have the required SDK versions. I recommend to install API 8, 10, 14. If it still doesn't work then also install API 17,18.

*Note: I have removed the previous facebook folder and added facebook-android-sdk-master which has an updated facebook folder.
